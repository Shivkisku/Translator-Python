# Translator-Python-English-to-hindi



The above Python code uses the Googletrans library to translate English text to Hindi.

First, the code imports the Translator class from the Googletrans library. Then, it creates an instance of the Translator class and sets the service URL to 'translate.google.com'.

Next, the code defines the text to translate in the text_to_translate variable, which in this case is "Hello, how are you?".

The translate() method of the translator object is then used to translate the English text to Hindi. The dest parameter is set to 'hi' to specify the destination language as Hindi.

Finally, the translated text is printed to the console using the print() function.

When you run the code, the output should be the Hindi translation of "Hello, how are you?" which is "नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?".

Overall, this code demonstrates how to use the Googletrans library in Python to translate text from one language to another.
